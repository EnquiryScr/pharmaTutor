# Research Plan: Comprehensive Platform Architecture for Advanced Tutoring Platforms

## Task Overview
Research and analyze comprehensive platform architecture for advanced tutoring platforms covering 10 key systems and save detailed technical analysis to `docs/platform_architecture/comprehensive_platform_architecture.md`.

## Research Objectives
1. Assignment submission and management systems (file uploads, plagiarism checking, grading workflows)
2. Query management and ticket systems (student support, FAQ automation, escalation workflows)
3. Real-time chat and messaging platforms (one-on-one, group chats, file sharing, video integration)
4. Article and content library systems (search, categorization, user-generated content, moderation)
5. Advanced tutoring features (screen sharing, whiteboard tools, recording capabilities)
6. Student management and progress tracking (analytics, performance dashboards, reporting)
7. Content creation tools for tutors (video recording, document creation, quiz builders)
8. Global payment processing and multi-currency support
9. Mobile app architecture and cross-platform development
10. Security and privacy features for international compliance (GDPR, FERPA, etc.)

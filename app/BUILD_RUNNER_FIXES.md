# Build Runner Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Serializable Syntax Errors ✅
- **Fixed** `base_model.dart`: Removed problematic abstract factory methods that were causing build runner to fail
- **Fixed** Abstract method declarations that prevented proper code generation

### 2. Mockito Configuration Errors ✅
- **Fixed** Package imports in test files: Changed from `package:pharmaT/` to `package:flutter_tutoring_app/`
- **Fixed** `@GenerateMocks` annotations to use correct class names
- **Fixed** Missing imports and incorrect class references

### 3. Code Generation Success ✅
- Successfully generated mock files:
  - `user_repository_test.mocks.dart`
  - `message_provider_test.mocks.dart`

## Build Runner Commands

### ✅ Working Commands
```bash
# Generate mocks and code
/workspace/flutter-sdk/flutter/bin/dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Or using flutter (deprecated but still works)
/workspace/flutter-sdk/flutter/bin/flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### For Future Development
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /workspace/app

# Generate mocks
/workspace/flutter-sdk/flutter/bin/dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Clean generated files if needed
/workspace/flutter-sdk/flutter/bin/dart run build_runner clean
```

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `lib/core/utils/base_model.dart` - Fixed abstract method declarations
- `test/data/repositories/user_repository_test.dart` - Fixed package imports and mockito configuration
- `test/presentation/providers/message_provider_test.dart` - Fixed package imports

### Generated Files (Auto-created)
- `test/data/repositories/user_repository_test.mocks.dart`
- `test/presentation/providers/message_provider_test.mocks.dart`

## Dependencies Confirmed
- `json_annotation: ^4.8.1`
- `json_serializable: ^6.7.1`
- `build_runner: ^2.4.7`
- `mockito: ^5.4.3`

## Build Status
✅ **All build runner errors have been resolved**
✅ **Mock files generated successfully**
✅ **Code generation working properly**

## Next Steps
1. Run tests to verify mock functionality
2. Use the working build runner commands for future development
3. Ensure all new model classes follow the established patterns

  "summary": "This Google search results page provides a comprehensive overview of the PEBC Pharmacist Qualifying Examination (PQE) requirements in Canada for both Canadian and International Pharmacy Graduates (IPGs). It details educational prerequisites, document evaluation, language proficiency, and practical experience requirements. The PQE itself is a two-part exam (MCQ and OSCE) that must be completed within a specific timeframe and has attempt limits. For IPGs, an additional PEBC Evaluating Exam is typically required before attempting the PQE. Passing the PEBC exams is a necessary step, but final licensure also depends on fulfilling specific provincial regulatory requirements, which may include further examinations and practical training.",
  "key_points": [
    "**Educational Requirement:** Candidates must hold a four-year bachelor's or six-year Doctor of Pharmacy degree from a recognized institution.",
    "**Document Evaluation:** Foreign qualifications must undergo a document evaluation process, or candidates must be exempt (e.g., graduates from ACPE-accredited programs).",
    "**Language Proficiency:** Fluency in English or French is required, typically demonstrated by a minimum IELTS score of 7.0 overall with no band below 6.5 for English.",
    "**Practical Experience:** A minimum amount of practical training or internship is generally required.",
    "**Qualifying Examination Structure:** The PQE consists of two parts: Part I (Multiple Choice Questions - MCQ) and Part II (Objective Structured Clinical Examination - OSCE).",
    "**Completion Timeline & Attempts:** Both parts of the PQE must be completed within three years of passing one of them, otherwise parts may expire. There is a limit on the number of attempts.",
    "**International Pharmacy Graduates (IPGs) Specific Process:** IPGs must first register with Pharmacists' Gateway Canada for credential evaluation, then pass the PEBC Evaluating Exam, and subsequently the two-part PEBC Qualifying Exam. They also need to complete supervised practical experience/bridging programs.",
    "**Provincial Licensure:** Passing the PEBC exams grants certification but does not guarantee licensure. Candidates must meet additional specific eligibility requirements of the provincial or territorial regulatory authority where they wish to practice, which may include a jurisprudence exam.",
    "**Canadian Graduates:** Must complete an ID and Education Verification process before applying for the exams.",
    "**Evaluating Exam for IPGs:** The Pharmacist Evaluating Examination is a multiple-choice exam for IPGs with a pass mark of 60 and allows 3 attempts.",
    "**Current Degree Standard:** While older Bachelor of Pharmacy degrees are recognized, the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) is the current minimum standard at most Canadian universities."

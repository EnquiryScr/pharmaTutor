  "summary": "To become a certified pharmacist in Canada as an international pharmacy graduate, several key requirements must be met, primarily overseen by the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC). Applicants must possess a minimum four-year undergraduate pharmacy degree from a recognized university and register with Pharmacists' Gateway Canada before starting the document evaluation process. The PEBC evaluates academic and professional credentials to ensure they are comparable to Canadian standards. While PEBC itself does not require an English language proficiency test for the document evaluation stage, candidates must satisfy language requirements for Canadian immigration and provincial licensing. A common standard is an IELTS Academic score of 7.0 overall with no band below 6.5, though other tests like OET may be accepted, and provincial requirements can vary. Beyond document evaluation, the certification pathway typically includes passing the PEBC Qualifying Examination (which, for some, has seen changes like the removal of the Evaluating Exam in 2025), completing a practical training period or internship, and successfully passing a provincial law exam. PEBC does not mandate prior professional experience for document evaluation, nor is it strictly required to be registered in one's home country, provided an explanation is given.",

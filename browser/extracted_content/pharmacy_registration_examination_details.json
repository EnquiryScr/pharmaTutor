  "summary": "The Pharmacy Board of Australia outlines the registration examination process required for pharmacists to achieve general registration in Australia. This process involves two main components: a written examination and an oral (practice) examination. The information is relevant for graduates of approved Australian programs and overseas qualified pharmacists who have met specific preliminary requirements, such as completing the KAPS or OPRA examinations. Candidates holding provisional registration (interns) must complete 75% of their supervised practice hours before being eligible to sit the examinations. Both the written and oral components must be passed within an 18-month timeframe. The written examination is conducted by the Australian Pharmacy Council (APC), while the oral examination is administered by Ahpra in various Australian capital cities, primarily face-to-face, with provisions for online delivery under exceptional circumstances. The page provides the schedule for 2026 oral examinations, including application open and close dates. Specific assessment criteria are detailed in linked documents, such as the Pharmacy oral examination (practice) candidate guide and on the APC website.",

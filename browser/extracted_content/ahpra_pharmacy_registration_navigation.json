While the detailed pharmacy registration requirements are not directly on the homepage, it is the authoritative starting point to navigate to that specific information. Users would typically find navigation options leading to individual National Boards, registration processes, and practitioner resources. The primary route for pharmacists would involve locating the 'Pharmacy Board of Australia' section.",
